# Additional Tips:

* Practice daily coding — building is the best way to learn
* Use official docs & codelabs:

  * Flutter: [https://flutter.dev/docs](https://flutter.dev/docs)
  * Dart: [https://dart.dev/guides](https://dart.dev/guides)
  * Firebase: [https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup)
